## Welcome to Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised webpage

### The Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised (BSS-R) is a 10-item self-report measure of satisfaction with the childbearing experience from the woman's perspective. 

The BSS-R was developed by [Hollins Martin and Martin in 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24252712) as a valid, reliable and quickly and easily completed measure of birth satisfaction.  The BSS-R is a multi-dimensional questionnaire which assesses three distinct but related dimensions of (i.) _Stress experienced during childbearing_, (ii.) _Women's attributes_ and (iii.) _Quality of care_.  These three sub-scales can be used independently and/or a _BSS-R total score_ generated.  Higher BSS-R scores (sub-scales and total score) indicates comparatively greater birth satisfaction.

The BSS-R has become due to it's ease of administration and scoring, excellent measurement, validity and reliability properties and evidence informed theoretical framework and underpinnings a popular measure for clinical and research use.  The BSS-R has been validated in English-speaking countries other than the UK, for example, [the USA](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02646838.2015.1024211) and systematic evaluation of these versions have demonstrated their equivalence to the [original version](http://www.womenandbirth.org/article/S1871-5192(16)30216-5/abstract).  The BSS-R has also been translated into non-English languages, an example being the Greek version. Again, evaluation of the measurement properties of this translated version has demonstrated it's equivalence to the [original version](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02646838.2016.1184747).

The BSS-R was selected in 2016 by the [International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM)](http://www.ichom.org/) as the measure of choice for assessing birth experience and recommended for global use in the standard set of outcomes measures for [Pregnancy and Childbirth](http://www.ichom.org/medical-conditions/pregnancy-and-childbirth/).
